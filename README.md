# Building a Basic React Calculator App with React 18 and useReducer Hook

(Site Preview)[https://react-calculator-rishi.netlify.app/]

## Introduction

In this project, I developed a simple calculator app using React 18, leveraging the power of the `useReducer` hook to manage state efficiently. The primary goal was to gain a solid understanding of the `useReducer` concept and its application in state management within a React application.

## Technologies Used

- React 18: Utilizing the latest version of React to take advantage of concurrent rendering and other performance improvements.
- `useReducer` Hook: Employed as the central mechanism for state management in the calculator app.

## State Management with `useReducer`

The `useReducer` hook provided a clean and structured approach to managing the app's state. It allowed for handling complex state logic in a more organized manner compared to traditional `useState`.

## Implementation Challenges

1. **Case Considerations:**

   - Dealing with various mathematical operations and ensuring the calculator handles each case accurately.
   - Addressing edge cases such as division by zero and other potential errors.

2. **User Input Validation:**

   - Validating and sanitizing user input to prevent unexpected behaviors.
   - Implementing a user-friendly interface to guide users through the input process.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensuring the calculator's responsiveness across different screen sizes and devices.
   - Adapting the layout to accommodate both portrait and landscape orientations.

## Conclusion

Building this React calculator app using React 18 and the `useReducer` hook was a valuable learning experience. It provided insights into effective state management and offered an opportunity to tackle real-world challenges in designing a responsive and user-friendly application. The project enhanced my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of React's capabilities.
